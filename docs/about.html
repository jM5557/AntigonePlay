				<p>Following Oedipus' death and with Creon sitting on the throne of Thebes, trouble arises in the kingdom. Polynices and Eteocles, both brothers of Antigone and Ismene (all children of Oedipus), come to war for the right to throne. Polynices leads a battle against Creon and Eteocles, leading to a duel between the two brothers that ends with their deaths.</p>

				<br>

				<p>Their slain bodies on the battefield, the two brothers are now to be given a proper burial. Creon, however, demands that Polynices' body be left to rot, as punishment for dissenting Thebes. Antigone must rise up in protest, but tragedy is not too far behind...</p>
