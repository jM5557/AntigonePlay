			<div id = "content">
				<p> <i>Antigone</i> is a story about family struggle that resonates to this day. There is much that can be learned about human nature from the inherent conflict that these characters face. </p> 

				<br>

				<p>Antigone herself stands tall in defiance to her king and uncle. Through courage in her actions, Antigone proves that sometimes protest can be mightier than any sword or title of superiority. Against Creon, Antigone wields a fervent desire to act upon what she feels is right. Although tragedy and conflict lead to her suicide, the impact of her deeds clearly affect Creon and themselves lead to a chain of reactions that befall the stubborn King of Thebes. </p> 

				<br>

				<p>Although the play is named after her, Antigone is not the only figure who falls victim to the tragedy about them. At her side is Haemon who is initially conflicted. Must he obey his father, whose word is the law? Or does he stick by his fiancee's side, 'till death do them apart? The play toys with the theme of whether or not we have to adhere to even the most strict and unreasonable of rules set forth to us by a higher power.</p> 

				<br>

				<p>In itself, the play is a criticism on how ruling with an iron grip is not often the best way to obtain loyalty. Creon, the aforemententioned king of Thebes is that kind of ruler. In his response to Polynices' dissent against Thebes, Creon chooses to make an example out of him. His main desire is to reinvigorate his kingdom's spirits and to show that he is an effective ruler. In doing so, however, Creon loses Antigone's respect for him. Punishing Antigone for her actions against his mandate results in even Haemon leaving him. Once tragedy ensues, it is clear that Creon's lack of a moral compass in his authoritarian ways is the cause.</p>

				<br>

				<p>By the play's end, it is perhaps of possible interpretation that Creon is just as much of a tragic figure as Antigone, both finding only suffering on their own sides of the coin.</p>
